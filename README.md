# Guardians of Sunshine

This is my implementation of the BMO game "Guardians of Sunshine" that appears on the Adventure Time show using Godot 4.3.

Inspiration: Season 2 Episode 16 - Guardians of Sunshine.

This is my first game using the Godot Engine, actually, this is my game ever.

I've chosen to replicate this specific game because of its simplicity and because i really like the show.

I plan to implement more games based on tv shows as i improve as a game dev.

This implementation is for learning purpose only.
